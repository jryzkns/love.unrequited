bittersweet wrapper over LÃ–VE

# "Throw your arms 'round me, give my heart ease"
- provides and interface for peripheral inputs. 
- implemented a storing and drawing system of images.
- functions to handle animation changes and user input.
- More To be added

## Template Usage
- `git clone` this repo as your project directory, rename as you like
- change the `project` variable in Makefile into the name of the project directory and simply run make inside the directory

## Note
- Should be obvious but this is more a work of art than a serious module for professional use. If you have suggestions I will be happy to hear them, but do not expect external PR's to be approved.

As this module grows, I will start to actually write documentation and tutorials on how to use this module. Bear with me
