# love.unrequited
wrapper over LÃ–VE

# "Throw your arms 'round me, give my heart ease"
This is simply a wrapper module for me to use LOVE2D more easily. I will extend this as time goes on.

## Current features
- provides and interface for button inputs. 
- implemented a storing and drawing system of images.
- functions to handle animation changes and user input.
- More To be added

##Template Usage
- `git clone` this repo as your project directory, rename as you like
- change the `project` variable in Makefile into the name of the project directory and simply run make inside th directory

As this module grows, I will start to actually write documentation and tutorials on how to use this module. Bear with me
